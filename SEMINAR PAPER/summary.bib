    Introduction: Introduce the concepts related to scheduling algorithms. Introduce the types of tasks seen in real-time systems (periodic and aperiodic). Lightly introduce the existing ways to schedule these tasks.\\
    Background: Focus more on aperiodic tasks, and discuss in more detail the ways there are to schedule them. Discuss their benefits and limitations and show an example.\\
    Algorithm: Introduce and discuss the PE algorithm and expand on its benefits, but also show limitations and conclude with an example to explain.\\
    Verification: Show verification of temporal properties using Priority Exchange with the same task set.\\
    Simulation: Simulate an example using the PE algorithm with FreeRTOS, and verify periodic tasks always meet their deadlines.\\
    Conclusion: Discuss areas where PE is used and mention improvements like the EPE algorithm.\\
    References: To be included separately.
