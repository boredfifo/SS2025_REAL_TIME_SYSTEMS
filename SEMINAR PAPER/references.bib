// phD dissertaion that introduces a new method for scheduling sporadic tasks called the Sporadic server. In the early sections of the paper,
he introduces the scheduling problems with respect to aperiodic tasks(polling server and background servicing) and explains the working concept
behind better algorithms (Deferable server and Improved priority exchange).

    Introduction: Introduce the concepts related to scheduling algorithms. Introduce the types of tasks seen in real-time systems (periodic and aperiodic). Lightly introduce the existing ways to schedule these tasks.\\
    Background: Focus more on aperiodic tasks, and discuss in more detail the ways there are to schedule them. Discuss their benefits and limitations and show an example.\\
    Algorithm: Introduce and discuss the PE algorithm and expand on its benefits, but also show limitations and conclude with an example to explain.\\
    Verification: Show verification of temporal properties using Priority Exchange with the same task set.\\
    Simulation: Simulate an example using the PE algorithm with FreeRTOS, and verify periodic tasks always meet their deadlines.\\
    Conclusion: Discuss areas where PE is used and mention improvements like the EPE algorithm.\\
    References: To be included separately.
